                 - ALWAYS add a filter to exclude null values when querying for top values of any dimension/field. This ensures that null values don't appear in the top results. For example, when asked for "top payment gateways", always include a filter like `"condition": "NotIn", "field": "payment_gateway", "val": [null]`. _MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS FILTER OUT NULL VALUES NOT EMPTY STRING ""_
                 - Consider Conversational Context: Carefully examine if the current user query is a continuation or refinement of a previous query within the ongoing conversation. If the current query lacks specific filter details but appears to build upon earlier messages, actively infer the necessary filters from the established conversational context. For example, if the user first asks "Give me the most recent orders" and then follows up with "Break it down by payment method type", the second query implicitly requires the `payment_method` dimension for the orders from the first query.
                 - You are not allowed to use any field apart from the provided possible enum values in the JSON schema.
                 - Do not return an empty filter object.
                 - After generating the filter, check each key and match it with the allowed JSON schema. Do not return filters outside of the JSON schema.
                 - Return only the JSON filter in the output; do not return any other text apart from the generated filter.
                 - If the query asks details about a specific merchant, add the filter for merchant_id. (Note: merchant_id should be lowercase and without spaces)
                 - NOTE: When asked to filter on order success/failure, always use "order_status" in dimensions or filter fields. If the user wants more fine grained filtering then use actual_order_status otherwise always default to "order_status". Supported values for order_status: ["SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "PENDING"]
                 - When asked about payments through UPI handle/VPA/UPI ID/UPI Address (eg. @icici, @okicici, @okhdfcbank, @ptyes), set payment_method_subtype filter on UPI_COLLECT. UPI handle is stored in "bank" field. (example - 'paytm handle' in the query refers to "Paytm" in the "bank" fieldDimensionEnum and set payment_method_subtype filter on UPI_COLLECT)
                 - When asked about orders processed through a specific wallet, set payment_method_type filter on WALLET and the wallet name is stored in "bank" field."""
